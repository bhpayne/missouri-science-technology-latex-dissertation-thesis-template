\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

This is where you typically restate the research questions posed in your introduction and provide the answers to said questions based on the preceding results and discussion sections. Also in this section, or a separate section if your conclusions are quite long, you will typically summarize future work: the important research questions that need to be addressed next to further this particular line of inquiry.
