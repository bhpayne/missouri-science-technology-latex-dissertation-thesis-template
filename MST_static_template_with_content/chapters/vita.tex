Conferences

Classification of Regimes of Wave in Non-Conservative Random Media
Ben Payne and Alexey G. Yamilov 
Presented by A Yamilov, 20091011
http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=FiO-2009-FMC3
In search of a criterion of Anderson localization applicable in random media with absorption or gain, we explore the parameter space of the system and identify different regimes in wave transport.
Frontiers in Optics, 2009
San Jose, CA 20091012


Effect of Evanescent Modes on Conductance Distribution in Disordered Waveguides
Ben Payne, Tom Mahler, and Alexey G. Yamilov 
Presented by B Payne, 20091011
http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=FiO-2009-FMC6
We demonstrate that proper account of evanescent modes in wave propagation results in a reduction of transport mean free path whilst preserving the universality of the conductance distribution and its single parameter scaling.
